My name is Bruna, and I first came to Tucson in 2014 to teach Portuguese language as a Fulbright Foreign Language Teaching Assistant. As I was going to spend only one academic year at the University of Arizona, International Friends appeared to be the perfect option to help me experience Tucson and American culture fully. My hosts Harold and Nancy welcomed me to their family and, since then, I have felt I have an important support outside my country, Brazil. With their company, I have witnessed beautiful events, such as the family’s Thanksgiving dinner, and visited important sites around Tucson, such as Catalina State Park (awesome for hiking!).

As it is so easy to fall in love with Tucson and the community, I decided to apply for a Ph.D. degree in Second Language Acquisition and Teaching to continue my studies in the University of Arizona and create more memories in Tucson. Fortunately, I was invited to be an IF Student Board Member for Fall 2016 and, since then, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with an amazing group of people. It is an honor to help organize events to enrich international students’ experience in the United States. This way, I would like to replicate all great memories of my first year in every new student’s heart living in Tucson.


I will take the liberty to thank all the Board Members and hosts in the name of the international students who had their lives touched and changed by the IF organization for their tireless effort in organizing so many cultural exchange opportunities.
